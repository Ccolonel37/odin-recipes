    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Step 1</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Step 2</li>
      <li>
        Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil.
        Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Step 3</li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high
        heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.
        Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble.
      </li>
      <li>Step 4</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot
        skillet, sprinkle with lemon-pepper, and brown on all sides, 5 to 7
        minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place in a 9x13-inch baking
        dish.
      </li>
      <li>Step 5</li>
      <li>
        Combine 1/2 of the crumbled bacon, sour cream, soup, milk, and ranch
        dressing mix in a bowl and mix until blended. Pour over chicken, add
        drained egg noodles, and stir. Sprinkle remaining bacon on top, cover
        with Colby-Jack cheese, and top with green onions.
      </li>
      <li>Step 6</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and chicken is no
        longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
